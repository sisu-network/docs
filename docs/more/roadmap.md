title: Roadmap
---
This is a planned timeline of Sisu network. The roadmap might be subject to change. You can check our website for any update on Sisu's work.

###  1. Cross chain token swap (Tail)
This is a testnet for swapping non-native tokens cross chain, including common tokens like ERC20 and NFT. Sisu dev team will work with other crypto teams who want to build DEX to release their testnet version. Sisu testnet and validator's group will be private at this stage.

### 2. Native coin swapping (Talon)
This stage enables user to do native coins/token swapping instead of using wrapped tokens. Liquidity provider can stake their contribution on testnet in reward for Sisu's tokens.

### 3. API hub for cross chain contracts (Spine)
"Instead of learning many blockchain's languages, Sisu deploys contract gateway at different chains and let developers interact with remote contracts through the gateway using their familiar languages.

You focus on the world and let Sisu handles the infrastructure, including other blockchain's updates. The source code and testnet are also opened for public at this stage."

### 4. Private transaction (Fang)
Many users do care about the privacy of their transaction. The Fang deployment offers users an option to shield their transaction with minor additional cost.

### 5. Mainnet (Heart)
The mainnet is launched and deployed on various blockchains with their ecosystems. You can enjoy all the features of Sisu that you see in testnet.
