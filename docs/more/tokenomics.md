## Does Sisu have its own tokens?

Sisu token is the native token of Sisu network. The token is used in various activities in the ecosystem, including paying for transaction fee, staking reward or governance voting. It could be used for future projects within Sisu's ecosystem, including a potential high throughput smart chain.

We will release the guideline details of how Sisu tokens could be used when our tokenomics is finalized.

## How is the Sisu token distributed?

The Sisu token will be distributed for the following category of usage:
- Community contribution (including airdrop)
- dApp ecosystem
- Founders & core team
- Early Investors
- Strategic partners.

The exact number for each category is not yet finalized. Designing a fair tokenomics that makes everyone happy is a complicated task. The ultimate goal is to build a sustainable token economy instead of a short-term pump & dump scheme. We would continue doing research on token distribution and update our plan from community's feedback.
