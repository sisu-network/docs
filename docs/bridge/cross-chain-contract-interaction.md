title: Cross Chain Contract Interaction
---
As the number of chains grows, the number of languages and frameworks we have to learn also increases. We, developers, used to learn Python, Java, C and then Go, Solidity. Now we have to learn Rust, Wasm to interact with new blockchains like Solana or Terra.

Learning a new language takes time. It is a lot more than taking a "Hello World" tutorial you find online. You are dealing with people's money, so you have to be extremely careful with the code you write.
To write secured code, you need to have a deep understanding of a new language or framework and this requires time no matter how senior you are when you start. You also need to keep up with best practices and framework updates.

*What if Sisu could be an API hub for you to interact with cross chain contracts without learning a new language?*

Imagine you are a solidity developer and you want to interact with a contracts on Terra blockchain which uses wasm for its smart contract engine. Instead of learning about Terra's framework and wasm, Sisu exposes a few API at our gateway so that you can interact with contracts on Terra through our gateway using your familiar Solidity language.

We believe building an API hub empowers developers to free their time learning a new language and let them focus on their core product. On the other hand, a contract deployed on one chain can now be used by users in different chains and hence extends its user base.

Different chains have different API and languages so it's not an easy task to design a universal API hub. But this is the goal we are striving for as it would open new possibilities and strategies when deploying a smart contract.
