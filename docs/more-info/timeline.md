Sisu network will be deployed through several phases: Testnet Phase 1, Testnet Phase 2 and Mainnet.

- Testnet Phase 1 is the rollout of EVM compatible engine. Developers can roll out their smart contracts on sisu testnet chain. Cross chain token transfer is not available in this phase yet.
- Testnet Phase 2 includes cross chain tokens transfer between sisu testnet and other EVM-based testnets.
- Mainnet is the full feature network of Sisu that interacts with other EVM-based mainnets.

Sisi is currently closed source but will be open sourced when it is closed to launching mainnet.
