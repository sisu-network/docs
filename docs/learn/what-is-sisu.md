title: What is Sisu?
---

Sisu network is a cross chain layer that connects and facilitates seamless transactions between L1, L2, side chains. Though tokens swapping (both native and fungible/non-fungible tokens) is a big part of Sisu's focus at the beginning, Sisu aims to solve more general cross chain communication like smart contract's interaction or confidential transactions.

With Sisu, you can mint your NFT or deploy your DeFi smart conrtact and then seamlessly transfer your assets into other chains.

This video summarizes what is Sisu about.
