## Why is privacy important in blockchain?
Privacy is important in blockchain for several reasons:

1. Confidentiality: Blockchain is often used to store sensitive information, such as financial transactions. In the future it could be extended to store personal identity information, or even medical records. Privacy is critical in these cases to protect the confidentiality of this information and prevent unauthorized access.

  In simple words, you don't want others to see what happened in your bank account though you do not have any malicious transaction. Even when a wallet address in blockchain is anonmyous, your identity could be revealed by taking a close look at who you are interacting with.

2. Security: By keeping transaction details private, users can reduce the risk of fraud and hacking. Public blockchains, where transaction details are visible to anyone, can be vulnerable to attacks where criminals try to exploit weaknesses in the system to steal sensitive information or funds.

3. Trust: Privacy is essential for building trust in the blockchain ecosystem. When users have confidence that their personal information and transactions will remain confidential, they are more likely to use and trust the system.
