# What is Sisu Network?

Sisu network is a decentralized, trustless layer that connects and facilitates seamless transactions between various blockchains. Sisu can support any L1, L2 or sidechain transactions whether it is a token swapping request or smart contract function call.

Though tokens swapping (both native and fungible/non-fungible tokens) is a big part of Sisu's focus at the beginning, Sisu aims to solve more general cross chain communication like smart contract's interaction or private transactions. Please refer to our roadmap for feature release of Sisu.

## What problem Sisu is solving?

The rise of recent blockchains like Solana, Avalance creates a need to transfer assets (forward and backward) between various chains. Ethereum 1.0 used to be the dominant network for smart contarct execution but other blockchains have gradually gained market share by offering more scalable and faster solution for users. From now on, we will live in a multi-chain world where there is no dominating player. Instead, we are moving into a paradigm where various blockchains co-exist.

We expect in 3 years, the total volume of transaction cross chain will be bigger than the volume of any single chain. We anticipate trillions of dollar of asset will be moved cross chain. This trend is irreversible, it's important to design a secured general solution for the incoming multi-chain world.
